# Crop Yield AI - IBM ELITE

A machine learning project for predicting crop yields using AI techniques to support agricultural decision-making and food security planning.

## 🌾 Overview

This project leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to predict crop yields based on various environmental and agricultural factors. The system aims to assist farmers, agricultural researchers, and policymakers in making informed decisions about crop production and resource allocation.

## 🚀 Features

- **Predictive Modeling**: Advanced ML algorithms for accurate crop yield prediction
- **Data Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of agricultural and environmental data
- **Visualization**: Interactive charts and graphs for data insights
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design for easy data input and result interpretation
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle various crop types and geographical regions

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip or conda package manager
- Git

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/samartharora25/Crop-Yield-AI_IBM_ELITE.git
cd Crop-Yield-AI_IBM_ELITE
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv crop_yield_env
source crop_yield_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: crop_yield_env\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📊 Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Place your agricultural data in the `data/` directory
2. **Training**: Run the training script to build the predictive model
3. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict crop yields for new data
4. **Visualization**: Generate charts and reports for analysis

```bash
# Example usage
python train_model.py
python predict_yield.py --input data/sample_input.csv
```
